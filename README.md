This is a `Java`, CLI implementation of the game Monopoly.

## Features

As for *Series G1* the features are not extensive;
there are two players that play on a 5x5 board.

Every player has a name and a unique symbol, which are assigned at the start of the
game.

There is a bank, which manages payments and fees throughout the game.

The bank, initially has 1'000'000.–, every player is then given 2'000.–

The player move clockwise on the board, by rolling a 4-D dice and every
time they land on a cell the relative fee is applied.

When the players pass the start cell, they are given 100.– as a bonus.

The game is over when one of the two players has lost all their money.
